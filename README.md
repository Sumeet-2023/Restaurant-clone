## Components and Containers

The project is organized into two main types of React components: **components** and **containers**.

### Components

Components are smaller, reusable pieces of the UI. They are often used by containers to build the complete interface. Examples of components in this project include:

- **Navbar**
- **SubHeading**
- **MenuItem**
- **FooterOverlay**
- **Newsletter**

### Containers

Containers are higher-level components that compose multiple components to form sections of the application. They manage the layout and organization of these sections. Examples of containers in this project include:

- **AboutUs**
- **Chef**
- **FindUs**
- **Footer**
- **Gallery**
- **Header**
- **Laurels**
- **SpecialMenu**

Each container is responsible for a distinct section of the website and brings together various components to create a cohesive UI.
